## üìä Task 1: Exploring and Visualizing the Iris Dataset

**Objective:**  
Understand how to read, summarize, and visualize a simple dataset.

**Approach:**  
- Loaded the Iris dataset using `pandas`.
- Displayed basic dataset information using `.shape`, `.columns`, and `.head()`.
- Created visualizations using:
  - **Scatter Plot** to show relationships between petal and sepal dimensions.
  - **Histogram** to examine the distribution of flower measurements.
  - **Box Plot** to detect outliers and understand value spread.

**Results and Insights:**  
- Found clear separability between different iris species based on petal length and width.
- Histogram showed petal length and width have distinct clusters for each species.
- Box plots revealed some outliers, particularly in petal dimensions.

## üí≥ Task 2: Credit Risk Prediction

**Objective:**  
Predict whether a loan applicant is likely to default on a loan.

**Approach:**  
- Handled missing values using appropriate techniques (e.g., imputation).
- Visualized key features such as `LoanAmount`, `ApplicantIncome`, and `Education`.
- Trained two classification models: **Logistic Regression** and **Decision Tree**.
- Evaluated models using **Accuracy** and **Confusion Matrix**.

**Results and Insights:**  
- The Decision Tree performed slightly better in terms of classification accuracy.
- Education and LoanAmount were significant factors influencing loan approval.
- Confusion matrix helped understand the trade-off between false positives and false negatives.

## üè¶ Task 3: Customer Churn Prediction

**Objective:**  
Identify customers likely to leave the bank.

**Approach:**  
- Cleaned the dataset and handled missing values.
- Encoded categorical variables like `Geography` and `Gender` using Label Encoding and One-Hot Encoding.
- Trained a **XGBoost Classifier Algorithm**.
- Analyzed **feature importance** to understand key churn drivers.

**Results and Insights:**  
- Achieved **accuracy of 87%**, **precision of 76%**, but a lower **recall of 49%**.
- Key features influencing churn included **Credit Score**, **Age**, and **Balance**.
- Feature importance helped in understanding what factors need attention for churn prevention.
